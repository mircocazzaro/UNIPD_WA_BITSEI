Our project (Business InTegrated System for Electronic Invoicing) aims to develop a web application utilizable by individual or juridical companies that let them keep track of daily selling to customers, being them physical goods or provided services, and from the data collected print out PDF warnings (used to ask for payments), courtesy PDF invoices and, most important, XML invoices compliant with Italian regulations. Also, data listing, insight plots, and notifications are part of the application.
