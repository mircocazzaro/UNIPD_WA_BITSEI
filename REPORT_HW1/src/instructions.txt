so i know that none one but unfortunaly here we are... :(

first of all, all the document is written in latex, that is praticaly like HTML but for document (the sintax is very different)
so plz look how to use tables and list, you will need it, but don't warry they are pretty simple and you should look how the template is made


1. so for stating add your main information in groupdata.tex
2. go in ./sections/Contributions.tex and write what have you done
3. in ./sections/BLL/RESTAPISummary.tex add all your rest api with every HTTP method that you use and add a simple description
4. in ./sections/BLL/RESTErrorCodes.tex add all error codes that you use, controll if the error is already in the table
5. in ./sections/BLL/RESTAPIDetails.tex describe in a better way what is the resuce, and add all the informatin asked in the template,

.bonus for mirco go ./sections/DLL here you will find where to add the ER schema, and in OtherInformation.tex you should describe the ER schema

TODO

there are parts that we should decide who is gonna do it:
./sections/Objectives.tex
    sef self explanatory, simple description were we say: wat our system will be used for? Why is it important? What problems does it solve?

./sections/MainFunctionalities.tex
    sef self explanatory, what services does offer our app and how it is organized?

./sections/PresentationLogicLayer.tex
    here we will add how the site is organized and show the mockups for the website 

./sections/BusinessLogicLayer.tex 
    here we should say how the classes are arranged and say how they works, here we should add the Sequence diagram
